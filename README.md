# PawTracking
Real-time clustering of mouse paw trajectory, with trajectory obtained from DeepLabCut.

Trajectory clustering is primarily done using TRACLUS (Lee, Han, & Whang, 2007), with adaptations to work in a real-time setting.

From this clustering, the mouse will be rewarded for specific paw movement, allowing for automated training of paw motion.
